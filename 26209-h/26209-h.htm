<p style="margin-top: 6em;"><i>And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in
the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be
for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of
the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein
there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was
so.</i>&mdash;Genesis i., 29, 30.</p>

<p><i>Thou shalt not kill.</i>&mdash;Exodus xx., 13.</p>

<p><i>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the
other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence
above a beast: for all is vanity. All go unto one place;
all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. Who knoweth the
spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that
goeth downward to the earth?</i>&mdash;Ecclesiastes iii., 19, 20, 21.</p>

<p><i>He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man.</i>&mdash;Isaiah lxvi., 3.</p>

<p><i>Then said Daniel to Melzar [the steward], whom the prince
of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and
Azariah: Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let
them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. Then let our
countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance
of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and
as thou seest, deal with thy servants. So he consented to them
in this matter, and proved them ten days. And at the end of
ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh
than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's
meat.</i>&mdash;Daniel i., 11 to 17.</p>

<p class="no-indent dropcap"><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">I send</span> this little book out into the world, first, to aid those
who, having decided to adopt a bloodless diet, are still
asking how they can be nourished without flesh; second, in the
hope of gaining something further to protect &ldquo;the speechless
ones&rdquo; who, having come down through the centuries under
&ldquo;the dominion of man,&rdquo; have in their eyes the mute, appealing
look of the helpless and oppressed. Their eloquent silence
should not ask our sympathy and aid in vain; they have a
right, as our humble brothers, to our loving care and protection,
and to demand justice and pity at our hands; and, as a
part of the One Life, to&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 26em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;life, which all can take but none can give;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Life, which all creatures love and strive to keep;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wonderful, dear, and pleasant unto each,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Even to the meanest; yea, a boon to all<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where pity is, for pity makes the world<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Soft to the weak and noble for the strong.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Unto the dumb lips of the flock he lent<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sad, pleading words, showing how man, who prays<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For mercy to the gods, is merciless,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Being as god to those; albeit all life<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is linked and kin, and what we slay have given<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Meek tribute of their milk and wool, and set<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fast trust upon the hands which murder them.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the cruelty and injustice to animals are nothing to us,
we have still another argument to offer&mdash;the brutalization of
the men who slaughter that we may eat flesh. Mrs. Besant,
in &ldquo;Why I Am a Food Reformer,&rdquo; says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lately I have been in the city of Chicago&mdash;one of the
greatest slaughter-houses of the world&mdash;where the slaughter-men,
who are employed from early morn till late at night in the
killing of thousands of these hapless creatures, are made a class
<i>practically apart from their fellow-men</i>; they are marked out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6">6</a></span>by the police <i>as the most dangerous part of the community</i>;
amongst them are committed most crimes of violence, and
the most ready use of the knife is found. One day I was
speaking to an authority on this subject, and I asked him how
it was that he knew so decidedly that most of the murders and
the crimes with the knife were perpetrated by that particular
class of men, and his answer was suggestive, although horrible.
He said: &#8216;There is a peculiar turn of the knife which men
learn to use in the slaughter-house, for, as the living creatures
are brought to them by machinery, these men slit their throats
as they pass by. That twist of the wrist is the characteristic
of most crimes with the knife committed amongst our Chicago
population.&#8217; That struck me at once as both a horrible and
significant fact. <i>What right have people to condemn other men
to a trade that makes them so readily take to the knife in anger;
which marks them out as specially brutalized&mdash;brutes amongst
their fellow-men?</i> Being constantly in the sight and the smell
of blood, their whole nature is coarsened; accustomed to kill
thousands of creatures, they lose all sense of reverence for
sentient life, they grow indifferent to the suffering they continually
see around them; accustomed to inflict pain, they grow
callous to the sight of pain; accustomed to kill swiftly, and
sometimes not even waiting until the creature is dead before
the skin is stripped from it, their nerves become coarsened,
hardened, and brutalized, and they are less men as men because
they are slaughterers of animals. <i>And everyone who eats flesh
meat has part in that brutalization; everyone who uses what they
provide is guilty of this degradation of his fellow-men.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;If I may not appeal to you in the name of the animals&mdash;if
under mistaken views you regard animals as not sharing <i>your
kind of life</i>&mdash;then I appeal to you in the name of <i>human brotherhood</i>,
and remind you of your duty to your fellow-men, your
duty to your nation, which must be built up partly of the children
of those who slaughter&mdash;who physically inherit the very
signs of this brutalizing occupation. I ask you to recognize
your duty as men and women who should <i>raise</i> the Race, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7">7</a></span><i>degrade</i> it; who should try to make it <i>divine</i>, not <i>brutal</i>; who
should try to make it <i>pure</i>, not <i>foul</i>; and therefore, in the
name of Human Brotherhood, I appeal to you to leave your
own tables free from the stain of blood and your consciences
free from the degradation of your fellow-men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That flesh-eating is not necessary to the perfect health of
man is attested by many scientists. The following testimonies
from some very prominent physiologists and anatomists may
prove interesting:</p>

<p>Sir Charles Bell, F. R. S.: &ldquo;It is, I think, not going too
far to say that every fact connected with the human organization
goes to prove that man was originally formed a frugivorous
animal. This opinion is principally derived from the formation
of his teeth and digestive organs, as well as from the character
of his skin and the general structure of his limbs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sylvester Graham, M. D.: &ldquo;Comparative anatomy proves
that man is naturally a frugivorous animal, formed to subsist
upon fruits, seeds, and farinaceous vegetables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Wm. Lawrence, F. R. S.: &ldquo;The teeth of man
have not the slightest resemblance to those of carnivorous
animals; and, whether we consider the teeth, jaws, or digestive
organs, the human structure closely resembles that of the frugivorous
animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Jozef Drzewiecki: &ldquo;There is no doubt that fruit and
vegetable food purifies the blood, while meat inflames and is
the source of many diseases, which are the punishment for
breaking the natural law and command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Vogt: &ldquo;The vegetarian diet is the most beneficial
and agreeable to our organs, as it contains the greatest
amount of carbon hydrates and the best proportion of albumen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Henry Thompson, M. D., F. R. C. S.: &ldquo;It is a vulgar
error to regard meat in any form as necessary to life. All that
is necessary to the human body can be supplied by the vegetable
kingdom.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The vegetarian can extract from his food
all the principles necessary for the growth and support of the
body, as well as for the production of heat and force. It must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8">8</a></span>be admitted as a fact beyond all question that some persons
are stronger and more healthy who live on that food. I know
how much of the prevailing meat diet is not merely a wasteful
extravagance, but a source of serious evil to the consumer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following special cablegram from London to the New
York &ldquo;Sun,&rdquo; July 3d, 1898, contains a practical illustration of
the superiority of a vegetable diet:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The vegetarians are making a great ado over the triumph
of their theory in the long-distance test of walking endurance,
seventy miles, in Germany, this week. The twenty-two starters
included eight vegetarians. The distance had to be covered
within eighteen hours. The first six to arrive were vegetarians,
the first finishing in 14&nbsp;&frac14; hours, the second in 14&nbsp;&frac12;, the third
in 15&nbsp;&frac12;, the fourth in 16, the fifth in 16&nbsp;&frac12;, and the sixth in
17&nbsp;&frac12;. The last two vegetarians missed their way and walked
five miles more. All reached the goal in splendid condition.
Not till one hour after the last vegetarian did the first meat-eater
appear, completely exhausted. He was the only one.
Others dropped off after thirty-five miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is no question of the great economy of vegetarianism.
Dr. Alcott, in &ldquo;Arguments for Vegetarianism,&rdquo; says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-two acres of land are needed to sustain one man
on fresh meat. Under wheat that land will feed forty-two people;
under oats, eighty-eight; under potatoes, maize, or rice,
one hundred and seventy-six; under the banana, over six thousand.
The crowded nations of the future must abandon flesh-eating
for a diet that will feed more than tenfold people by the
same soil, expense and labor. How rich men will be when they
cease to toll for flesh-meat, alcohol, drugs, sickness, and war!&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a name="BEATEN_BISCUIT-1">BEATEN BISCUIT.&mdash;No. 1.</a></h3>

<p>One quart of flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking
powder sifted with the flour, a quarter of a teaspoonful
of salt, a large heaping tablespoonful of butter,
milk enough to make a stiff dough. Beat with
a rolling pin or in a biscuit-beater for ten or fifteen

<h3><a name="BEATEN_BISCUIT-2">BEATEN BISCUIT.&mdash;No. 2.</a></h3>

<p>Two quarts of flour, three ounces of butter, a
little salt and enough water to make a stiff dough.
Beat with a rolling pin or in a biscuit-beater twenty
minutes until the dough blisters or snaps. Roll out

<p>Melt half a cup of butter in three-quarters of a
pint of warm milk, dissolve one cake of compressed
yeast in a little tepid milk, stir together and add a
teaspoonful of salt and enough flour to make like
bread dough, set to rise in a warm place. It will rise

<h3><a name="ELIZABETTI_ROLLS">ELIZABETTI ROLLS.</a></h3>

<p>One cup of sweet milk, half a yeast cake, an even
tablespoonful of butter, two teaspoonfuls of sugar,
and one of salt, and flour enough to make as stiff as
bread dough. Scald the milk and melt the butter in
it, when lukewarm dissolve the yeast cake, sugar and
salt and stir the flour in until as thick as bread
dough. Set to rise over night. In the morning roll
thin, cut with a biscuit-cutter, put a tiny lump of
butter on each biscuit, fold in half, set to rise again,
and when light bake about twenty minutes in a
moderate oven. This quantity will make twenty-four
rolls.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="RYE_ROLLS">RYE ROLLS.</a></h3>

<p>Take in the morning from rye bread dough one
cupful, add to it a tablespoonful of Porto Rico molasses,
one tablespoonful of sour cream, one even
tablespoonful of butter. Bake in cups, half fill them,

<h3><a name="GLUTEN_ROLLS">GLUTEN ROLLS.</a></h3>

<p>Three cups of kernel flour, two even tablespoonfuls
of baking powder, half a teaspoonful of salt,
two cups of milk. Mix the flour, salt and baking
powder together, then stir in the milk, beat well. If
baked in iron roll pans heat them well, brush with
butter; if granite ware, only grease them. This
quantity will make sixteen rolls. Bake from twenty
to twenty-five minutes.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="PARKER_HOUSE_ROLLS">PARKER HOUSE ROLLS.</a></h3>

<p>Sift two cups of flour with half a teaspoonful of
salt and one teaspoonful of sugar, then add a cup of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16">16</a></span>tepid water in which a cake of compressed yeast has
been dissolved, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter;
when mixed break in one egg and add flour enough
to make a soft dough. Knead well, beating the
dough upon the board. Set to rise in a warm place,
when light knead again, adding only enough flour to
keep from sticking to the board, roll out about half
an inch thick, cut with a biscuit-cutter, brush with
melted butter, fold in half and set to rise again.
These rolls can be set at noon if for tea, or in the
morning if for luncheon, or they can be made up at
night for breakfast, when use only half a yeast cake.
This dough can be moulded into small, oblong rolls
for afternoon teas.</p>

<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="BOSTON_BROWN_BREAD_WITH_RAISINS">BOSTON BROWN BREAD WITH RAISINS.</a></h3>

<p>Follow the <a href="#BOSTON_BROWN_BREAD">preceding recipe</a>, adding a cup of raisins

<p>Dissolve half a yeast cake, two heaping teaspoonfuls
of sugar and one of salt in a cup and a
third of tepid water, then stir into it a pint of white
flour, and when smooth add enough rye flour to
make a dough rather stiffer than that of white
bread. Knead thoroughly about fifteen minutes and
set to rise. In the morning make into a loaf and put
in a crusty bread pan.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="QUICK_WHITE_BREAD">QUICK WHITE BREAD.</a></h3>

<p>Three pints of flour, an even teaspoonful of salt,
two cakes of compressed yeast dissolved in tepid

minutes.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="DATE_BREAD">DATE BREAD.</a></h3>

<p>Break the dates apart, wash and drain them in a
colander, shake them well, set in a warm place to

<p>One pound of flour, two eggs, six tablespoonfuls
of melted butter, six ounces of sugar, a teaspoonful
of soda, a teaspoonful of cream of tartar mixed dry
in the flour, and one cup and a half of milk. Beat
the butter and sugar together, add the eggs well
beaten, a few grains of cardamom, half a cupful of
raisins seeded, and a tablespoonful of citron cut fine,
if liked, then add the milk and flour. Bake in crusty
bread pans or shallow pans, as convenient.</p>

<p>Two pounds and a half of flour, a pint and a half
of milk, half a pound of butter, six ounces of sugar,
one even teaspoonful of cardamom seeds pounded fine,
and one cake of compressed yeast. Melt the butter
in the milk, mix the sugar, flour and cardamom
together and stir the butter and milk into it with
the yeast cake dissolved in a little milk, mix thoroughly
and set to rise. When it is nicely raised, roll
out the dough and cut with a biscuit-cutter, put in

it is better. When light bake in a quick oven. If
zwieback are wanted, cut the biscuit in half when
cold and set them in the oven to brown. If wanted
very nice, brush each half over with white of egg and
sprinkle with sugar and chopped almonds. The cardamom
seed may be omitted if not liked.</p>

<p>Boil a scant half cup of rice in salted water half
an hour, drain well, and measure out four heaping
tablespoonfuls of it into a mixing bowl. Stir into it
while hot a heaping tablespoonful of butter. Beat
one egg light, add to the rice and butter with a little
salt, sift half a pint of flour with half a teaspoonful
of baking powder, and stir in alternately with half a
pint of milk. Pour the mixture into muffin rings or
gem pans, which must be heated thoroughly and well
buttered. Bake about twenty minutes.</p>

quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, three eggs beaten
separately and very light. Mix the flour, salt and
milk together, then the yolks of eggs, and lastly the
whites of eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Have a gem
pan very hot, butter well and fill with the batter and
bake in a quick oven twelve to fifteen minutes. This

<h3><a name="ENGLISH_MUFFINS">ENGLISH MUFFINS.</a></h3>

<p>Half a pint of hot milk, half a pint of hot water,
half a yeast cake, an even teaspoonful of salt and
one of sugar, and about a pound and a half of white
flour. Dissolve the yeast cake in a little tepid water
and add to the batter when lukewarm. The milk
and water mixed must be stirred into the flour while
hot. Beat the batter very hard, ten or fifteen minutes;
it should be a soft dough. Set to rise over
night. Flour the board well, drop the dough in large
spoonfuls in the flour, flatten with the hands and
form into shape. Let them rise on the board in a
warm place, and when light bake on a griddle,
heated only half as hot as for griddle cakes. Flour
the muffins and bake slowly on one side six minutes;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20">20</a></span>then turn and bake the same on the other side. They
are very nice split and toasted and buttered immediately
and put together again.</p>

<h2>Vegetables.</h2>


<div class="intro"><p>Vegetables should be cooked in as little water as possible; the
better way is to steam them. So much of the valuable salts are
washed out by boiling in too much water.</p>

<p>All vegetables left over can be warmed again, either in a cream
sauce, or put in a double boiler and steamed, adding a little more
butter.</p>

<p>When pepper is used, it should always be white pepper, especially
in white sauces and soups.</p>

<p>Never salt vegetables until they are nearly cooked; it hardens
them.</p>

<p>The water vegetables are boiled in may be utilized in making
sauces and soups; the best of the vegetables goes into it.</p>

<p>The water Jerusalem artichokes are boiled in becomes quite
a thick jelly when cold, and makes an excellent foundation for
sauces.</p></div>

<p>Put a slightly heaping tablespoonful of butter,
a tablespoonful of cream, and half a teaspoonful of
sugar into a saucepan on the stove, mix well, and
when it boils add a heaping tablespoonful of flour&mdash;as
much as will stay on the spoon&mdash;let it come to a
boil, and then add three-quarters of a cup of cooked
and finely chopped spinach, beat well and remove
from the fire. When cold add two eggs, one at a
time, season with salt and pepper to taste and half a
saltspoonful of powdered mace. Have a saucepan
of boiling water, slightly salted, on the stove; dip a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75">75</a></span>tablespoon in cold water, and then take up enough
of the spinach mixture to make an oblong cake, in
shape like an egg cut in half lengthwise, then dip the
spoon in the boiling water and let the cake float off.
Use all the mixture in this way. The balls will cook
in four or five minutes, and they must not boil too
fast or they will break. Let them drain in a colander
while making a cream sauce, and when the sauce is
made put the balls into it and let them come to a
boil, turn out on a platter and garnish with parsley.</p>

<h3><a name="BANANA_FRITTERS">BANANA FRITTERS.</a></h3>

<p>Half a pint of sweet milk, a scant half pint of
flour, two rounded teaspoonfuls of baking powder
and a small pinch of salt, stir all together; this
should make a batter as thick as that of cake. Roll
the pieces of fruit in it with a fork, and drop quickly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99">99</a></span>into boiling fat. The batter should be prepared just
as it is wanted and not allowed to stand. Cut three
medium-sized bananas into three pieces each and
divide each slice lengthwise so that the fruit will be
thin enough to cook thoroughly while the batter is
browning. This recipe will make eighteen small fritters.

tablespoonful of bread crumbs and one of sugar.
Then separate the three remaining eggs, the yolks
from the whites, adding one yolk at a time alternately
with bread crumbs and sugar until all are
used. Add the cherries. Beat the three whites of
eggs to a stiff froth and fold it in lightly. Butter
thick a cake mould, sift dried bread crumbs over it,
turn the cake into it and bake about three-quarters
of an hour in a moderate oven. Test it as other cake.
In Bavaria it is served cold, but I think it would also
be nice hot with fruit sauce.</p>

<p>Have all the ingredients measured or weighed,
the pans lined with paper or oiled, the nuts or fruit
prepared, and the flour sifted before beginning to
make a cake. Sift the baking powder and cream of
tartar and soda with the flour or a part of it. Use
pastry flour for all cake. Never put all the milk into
a cake batter by itself, as it curdles and makes a
coarse grained cake, but stir it in alternately with

and soak them with the currants in just
water enough to cover, stew until tender, and
add when cold with the water to the other ingredients.
Mix thoroughly, stirring in the melted butter
at the last. Let it stand for several days. The
brandy and wine may be omitted and more lemons
and oranges used to flavor it. At each baking it is
well to add a little sugar and chopped apple. This
will keep all winter or longer in a cool place, if the
brandy and wine are not omitted.</p>

<p>Skin the chestnuts and cover with cold water, let
them cook gently until tender, when a large needle
can be run through them easily. Drain and drop
them in cold water. After two hours drain again
and put them in a bowl, cover them with a rich syrup
that has been skimmed and boiled until clear. It
must be boiling when poured over the chestnuts.
Cover the bowl with a heavy paper and let it stand
for twelve hours, drain off the syrup, bring it to the
boiling point and turn it over the chestnuts again
and put away for another twelve hours. Repeat this
process three times, then drain the syrup off and the
chestnuts are ready for use. Use the large imported
chestnuts, remove the shells and boil the nuts. The
brown skin can then be easily removed with a penknife.
They are very nice but very troublesome to
prepare.</p>

<h3><a name="PRESERVE_OF_MIXED_FRUITS">PRESERVE OF MIXED FRUITS.</a></h3>

<p>Five pounds of ripe currants or cherries, five
pounds of granulated sugar, two pounds of seeded
raisins, the pulp of six oranges cut in small pieces,
and the rind of two oranges cut fine. Boil three-quarters
of an hour. Grapes can be used instead of
currants or cherries.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="RED_CURRANT_JAM">RED CURRANT JAM.</a></h3>

<p>Pick the currants from the stems, weigh them, and
allow three-quarters of a pound of white sugar to a
pound of the fruit. Put the currants in a preserving
kettle, mash them a little to prevent them from sticking
to the kettle, and boil for fifteen minutes, then
add the sugar and boil rapidly for ten minutes.
Bottle and seal tight.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="RED_CURRANT_JELLY">RED CURRANT JELLY.</a></h3>

<p>Berries for jelly must be picked when the weather
is dry. Pick them over, taking out all leaves, etc.,
put them in the kettle and mash them a little to get
enough juice to keep them from burning; stir constantly,
and as soon as hot wring them dry through
a cheese cloth. Measure the liquid and to every pint
of juice allow one pound of sugar. Put the juice on
the fire and boil fifteen minutes, then add the sugar
and boil fifteen minutes more, skimming thoroughly.
Pour into glasses while hot; let them stand until the
next day and cover. Very often jelly is soft, and
always from one of two reasons: either the berries
have been picked immediately after a rain or the
sugar is adulterated.</p>

cloth. Measure the juice and return it to the fire, let
it cook fifteen minutes, then add a pound of granulated
sugar to each quart of juice, boil gently fifteen
minutes, skimming as long as the scum rises. Bottle
and cork well and keep in a dark place. Raspberry

<div class="new-h2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156">156</a></span></div>
<h2>Savory Sauces.</h2>


<p>In making sauces great care should be taken to
have the saucepans scrupulously clean and only
granite-ware or porcelain-lined saucepans should be
used, especially where there is any acid as in tomatoes
or pickles. Never use an iron spider except for
browning butter and flour together as they will not
brown in a saucepan.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="VEGETABLE_STOCK_FOR_SAUCES">VEGETABLE STOCK FOR SAUCES.</a></h3>

<p>Take any kinds of vegetables convenient, such as
parsnips, celery, carrots, turnips, green pepper, onion,
leek, parsley, celery tops, celery root, Jerusalem artichokes,
a bay leaf, two cloves, two allspice, and cook
in water until tender; strain, pressing all from the
vegetables. The water Jerusalem artichokes are
boiled in is valuable for sauces. The liquid from
canned peas is also excellent. Care must be taken in
putting the vegetables together not to let any one
predominate, turnip especially, as it makes a sauce
very bitter.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="COLORING_FOR_SAUCES_SOUPS_Etc">COLORING FOR SAUCES, SOUPS, Etc.</a></h3>

<p>Melt a quarter of a pound of granulated sugar in
a spider, cook until it is a very dark, rich brown,
almost black, stir constantly. Great care must be
taken that it does not burn. When done pour over
it a quart of boiling water and let it cook until the
caramel is entirely dissolved, pour it out and when
cold strain and bottle. It will keep indefinitely and
a tablespoonful will give color to a pint of liquid.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="OLIVE_SAUCE">OLIVE SAUCE.</a></h3>

<p>Melt a heaping tablespoonful of butter in a
spider and when it begins to brown stir into it a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157">157</a></span>heaping tablespoonful of flour, let it cook until a
very dark brown, but be careful not to let it burn,
then add enough rich vegetable stock to make a
thick cream-like sauce. Have ready some olives&mdash;six
or seven, that have been boiled a few minutes in
water and cut from the stones, add these to the
sauce, season with pepper and salt to taste, bring to
the boiling point and serve.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="SAUCE_HOLLANDAISE">SAUCE HOLLANDAISE.</a></h3>

<p>One-quarter of a pound of butter, one-quarter of
a cup of water, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of salt,
the juice of a quarter of a lemon, a dash of cayenne,
and the yolks of three eggs. Beat the butter to a
cream and stir in the yolks of eggs, one at a time,
then the lemon juice, salt and pepper. Set the bowl
it is mixed in in a pan of boiling water on the fire,
beating constantly with an egg beater, and when it
begins to thicken stir in gradually the boiling water.
When it is as thick as soft custard it is done. Great
care must be taken not to let it remain too long on
the fire or it will curdle.</p>

<h2>Sandwiches.</h2>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="CHEESE_SANDWICHES">CHEESE SANDWICHES.</a></h3>

<p>Half a pound of grated cheese, one tablespoonful
of butter, the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs mashed
very fine and a teaspoonful of mayonnaise dressing.
Mix the ingredients thoroughly; butter before cutting
from the loaf some slices of brown or white
home-made bread; spread with the mixture and fold
together.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="CELERY_SANDWICHES">CELERY SANDWICHES.</a></h3>

<p>Use dainty little baking powder biscuits freshly
baked but cold, or white home-made bread for these
sandwiches. Only the very tender part of celery
should be used and chopped fine and put in iced water
until needed. Add a few chopped walnuts to the
celery and enough mayonnaise dressing to hold them
together; butter the bread before cutting from the
loaf, spread one slice with the mixture and press another
over it. If biscuits are used, split and butter
them. They should be small and very thin for this
purpose and browned delicately.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="NUT_AND_CREAM_CHEESE_SANDWICHES">NUT AND CREAM CHEESE SANDWICHES.</a></h3>

<p>Boston brown bread buttered on the loaf and cut
in very thin slices; spread with a filling of cream
cheese and chopped walnut meats; press a buttered
slice over it. They may be cut in fingers, rounds or
half-moons. The proportion is three-quarters of a
cup of nuts to a ten-cent package of Philadelphia
cream cheese. This quantity will make a large number
of sandwiches.</p>


<div class="new-h3"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160">160</a></span></div>
<h3><a name="NUT_SANDWICHES">NUT SANDWICHES.</a></h3>

<p>Graham, rye, and Boston brown bread make very
nice sandwiches. Butter the loaf and cut in very thin
slices, sprinkle with chopped nuts and fold together.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="WHOLE_WHEAT_BREAD_AND_PEANUT_SANDWICHES">WHOLE WHEAT BREAD AND PEANUT SANDWICHES.</a></h3>

<p>Chop the nuts very fine, butter the bread before
cutting from the loaf, sprinkle the nuts thickly over
the butter, press two slices together. Boston brown
bread with raisins is also nice for these sandwiches.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="OLIVE_SANDWICHES">OLIVE SANDWICHES.</a></h3>

<p>Prepare the bread and butter as for other sandwiches.
It may be cut in squares, rounds or triangles
to suit the fancy. Stone and chop as many
Queen olives as needed and mix with them enough
mayonnaise dressing to hold together, spread half
the number of bread slices with the mixture and
cover with the other half.</p>

<p>Brown, rye, whole wheat or white bread may be
used. Home-made is preferable, but it must be
twelve hours old. Sandwiches may be sweet or savory,
may be cut round, square, or in triangles.</p>

Parmesan cheese grated (it is better to buy the cheese
by the pound and have it grated at home), and two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162">162</a></span>ounces of butter. Rub the butter into the flour, add
the cheese and a little salt and cayenne pepper, and
make into a paste with the yolk of an egg; roll the

buttered tin cup, stand in a saucepan with a little
boiling water in it on the stove, cover and cook until
stiff&mdash;about three or four minutes&mdash;remove from the
fire, turn out of the cup. When ready to use cut in
half-inch slices and then into stars or any fancy shape
preferred, or into dice. Make a cream sauce thicker
than for other uses, that it may not run through the
pastry; put them in the sauce, bring to the boiling
point and fill the patties just as they are to be served.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Recipes.</h2>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="TOOTH_POWDER">TOOTH POWDER.</a></h3>

<p>Precipitated chalk, seven ounces; Florentine orris,
four ounces; bicarbonate of soda, three ounces; powdered
white Castile soap, two ounces; thirty drops
each of oil of wintergreen and sassafras. Sift all together
and keep in a glass jar or tin box. A very
valuable recipe for hardening the teeth.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="JAPANESE_CREAM">JAPANESE CREAM.</a></h3>

<p>Four ounces of ammonia, four ounces of white
Castile soap cut fine, two ounces of alcohol, two
ounces of Price's glycerine and two ounces of ether.
Put the soap in one quart of water over the fire;
when dissolved add four quarts of water; when cold
add the other ingredients, bottle and cork tight. It
will keep indefinitely. It should be made of soft
water or rain water. To wash woolens, flannels,
etc., take a teacup of the liquid to a pail of lukewarm
water, and rinse in another pail of water with half a
cup of the cream. Iron while damp on the wrong
side. For removing grass stains, paint, etc, use half
water and half cream.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="ORANGE_FLOWER_LOTION_FOR_THE_COMPLEXION">ORANGE FLOWER LOTION FOR THE COMPLEXION.</a></h3>

<p>Dissolve a slightly heaping tablespoonful of Epsom
salts in a pint of imported orange flower water
(Chiris de Grasse), and add to it one tablespoonful
of witch hazel. Apply with a soft linen cloth. Very
refreshing in warm weather and an excellent remedy
for oiliness of the skin.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="BAY_RUM">BAY RUM.</a></h3>

<p>Three-quarters of an ounce of oil of bay, one
ounce of loaf sugar, one pint of alcohol, 95 per cent.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166">166</a></span>two quarts of new New England rum and three pints
of rectified spirits, 60 per cent. Roll the sugar until
fine and beat into the oil of bay, add the alcohol, then
the New England rum and spirits. Let it stand for
several days in a demijohn, shaking occasionally;
then filter through blotting paper. The filters may
be purchased at a druggist's. Care should be taken
to buy the oil at a reliable place.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="FINE_LAVENDER_WATER">FINE LAVENDER WATER.</a></h3>

<p>Two ounces finest oil of lavender, one ounce
essence of musk, one-half ounce essence of ambergris,
one-half ounce oil of bergamot and one-half gallon of
rectified spirits. Mix the ingredients, keep in a demijohn
for several days, shaking occasionally. Then
filter and bottle.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="GOOD_HARD_SOAP">GOOD HARD SOAP.</a></h3>

<p>Five pounds of grease, one quart and one cup of
cold water, one can of potash, one heaping tablespoonful
of borax, two tablespoonfuls of ammonia.
Dissolve the potash in the water, then add the borax
and ammonia and stir in the lukewarm grease slowly
and continue to stir until it becomes as thick as thick
honey; then pour into a pan to harden. When firm
cut into cakes. Grease that is no longer fit to fry in
is used for this soap. Strain it carefully that no particles
of food are left in it. It makes no difference
how brown the grease is, the soap will become white
and float in water. It should be kept a month before
using.</p>


<div class="new-h3"></div>
<h3><a name="POLISH_FOR_HARD_OR_STAINED_WOOD_FLOORS">POLISH FOR HARD OR STAINED WOOD FLOORS.</a></h3>

<p>Eight ounces of yellow beeswax, two quarts of
spirits of turpentine, one quart of Venetian turpentine.
Cut the wax in small pieces and pour the
spirits over it&mdash;it will soon dissolve; then bottle.
Apply with a flannel or soft cloth. It keeps the floors
in excellent order.</p>

have experimented with carrageen or Irish moss and the Sea-moss
Farine preparation, and find them unsatisfactory. It is impossible
to make a clear jelly with them, and by soaking in water to destroy the
sea flavor, the solidifying property is lost. In England they have a vegetable
gelatine (Agar Agar) which makes, I am told, a clear, sparkling
jelly, and is said not to be expensive. I trust that before many months
it may be obtainable here. I have ventured, therefore, to give a few
recipes where gelatine is used, knowing that there will be something to
replace it. Groult's tapioca and potato flour are said to be unadulterated,
and with fresh fruit juices make nice and wholesome desserts, especially
for children. These preparations are made in France, and put up
in half-pound packages, and sold by all of our leading grocers.</p></div>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
